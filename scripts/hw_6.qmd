We are using R for this assignment [@rcite]. To import the data, @herecite created a package that helps us find the file we want to use in the assignment. Additionally, we are using the tidyverse to help organize our data [@tidycite]. Then, to create the figure, @ggcite made a comprehensive package that allows us to make graphs and figures with multiple different formating options.
